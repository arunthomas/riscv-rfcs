# RISC-V RFCs

This repository is meant to hold Request for Comments (RFCs) for
[RISC-V](http://riscv.org), an open instruction set specification.

As the RISC-V community grows, it will need to decide on a **process** for
defining RISC-V standards and enhancements. One option is to use a
GitHub repository such as this to capture proposals to enhance the
RISC-V ISA or other aspects of the RISC-V project.
