# RFC 1: RFC Process

## Introduction

As the RISC-V community grows, it will need to decide on a **process** for
defining RISC-V standards, enhancements, and extensions. One option is to use a
GitHub repository such as this to capture proposals to enhance the
RISC-V ISA or other aspects of the RISC-V project.

## Proposal

* Use a GitHub repository to host RISC-V RFCs
* Use Markdown for RFCs
* RFC authors will submit RFCs for review using GitHub pull requests
* RFC discussion can occur on the isa-dev mailing list as well as GitHub

## Alternatives

* Phabricator instead of GitHub
* LaTeX instead of Markdown
* RFCs are submitted for review on isa-dev mailing list
* All discussion occurs on isa-dev mailing list

## Notes

RFC 1 will be fleshed out over time. Pull requests strongly
encouraged.
